# C-LOOK is similar to the C-SCAN disk scheduling algorithm. In C-LOOK, the disk arm in spite of going to the end 
# goes only to the last request to be serviced in front of the head and then from there goes to the other endâ€™s last request. 
# Thus, it also prevents the extra delay which occurred due to unnecessary traversal to the end of the disk.
